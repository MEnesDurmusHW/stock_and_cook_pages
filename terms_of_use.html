    <h1>Terms & Conditions for Stock & Cook</h1>

    <p>By downloading or using the Stock & Cook app, these terms will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. Attempting to extract the source code of the app or translating the app into other languages or making derivative versions is also prohibited. The app itself, along with all trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, remain the property of the app's developer.</p>

    <p>The developer is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, the developer reserves the right to make changes to the app or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. The developer will never charge you for the app or its services without clearly informing you of what you are paying for.</p>

    <p>The Stock & Cook app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us to provide our service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We recommend against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as this could compromise your phone's security features and affect the app's functionality.</p>

    <p>Please note that certain functions of the app require an active internet connection. While the app can use Wi-Fi or data provided by your mobile network provider, we cannot guarantee full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi or available data.</p>

    <p>If you are using the app outside an area with Wi-Fi, the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider still apply, and you may be charged for data usage. You are responsible for any such charges, including roaming data charges, if applicable.</p>

    <p>The developer cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app. You must ensure that your device remains charged, as the developer cannot be held responsible if your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the service.</p>

    <p>While we strive to keep the app updated and correct at all times, we rely on third parties to provide information to us. The developer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, resulting from relying solely on the app's functionality.</p>

    <p>We may update the app from time to time, and it is your responsibility to download updates to continue using the app. The developer does not guarantee that it will always update the app to be relevant or compatible with your device's operating system. The developer reserves the right to stop providing the app and terminate its use at any time without notice.</p>
